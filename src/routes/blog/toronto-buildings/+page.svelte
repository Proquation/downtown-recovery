        <h3>Understanding post-pandemic recovery for individual buildings </h3>

        <p>By <a href="">Byeonghwa Jeong</a>, <a href="">Karen Chapple</a> & <a href="">Jeff Allen</a> | December 15, 2023</p> 


        <p>
            On this site, we've tracked post-pandemic recovery patterns in the downtowns of many North American cities, based on location-based mobility data from cell phones supplied by Spectus. While we've compared recovery across different cities, and users to explore different definitions of downtown, policymakers often need more fine-grained data to determine how recovery is progressing at the city block or individual building level.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here we examine recovery rates (comparing activity in spring 2023 to spring 2019) for 119 buildings located in the Toronto Financial District Business Improvement Area (BIA); most are either office (45%), office plus retail (33%), or retail only (11%) buildings. The map below reveals substantial variation in recovery across the area: the darker the red, the lower activity in 2023 compared to 2019, and the darker the blue, the higher the rate of recovery.
        </p>

        <p>
            Specifically, to estimate the recovery rate of each building, we counted the total unique daily visitors from March to May 2023, dividing it by the total unique daily visitors in corresponding months in 2019. Before dividing, both totals were normalized by the total number of unique devices in the City of Toronto, to account for changing sampling rates over time. A recovery rate lower than 100% indicates that the number of visitors from March to May 2023 had not yet recovered to the same period in 2019. For more details on how we are measuring recovery from this data, view our  <a href="/methodology">methodology</a> page.
        </p>

        <p>  
            The building that recorded the highest rate of change was CIBC Square (Phase I with 3026%) followed by Wildeboer Dellelce Place and the building at 9 Temperance St (369% and 344% respectively). In the case of CIBC Square, it was under construction during the before-pandemic period and opened in 2021, which led to a massive increase in recovery rates. It also has a regional bus terminal on it's ground floor. The building that recorded the lowest recovery rate was the HSBC Building at 70 York St (7%) and the Lumsden Building at 6 Adelaide St E (7%). These buildings likely had tenants that moved out during the pandemic and have not had their spaces refilled by spring 2023.

        <h2>Recovery Rates By Building Type</h2>

        <p>
            Below we create dot distribution charts of building recovery rates by the four most prominent building types. Each dot represents a single building, placed on the X-axis pertaining to its recovery rate.
        </p>
        <p>
            The vast majority of office and retail buildings have not recovered to their pre-pandemic level of activity, likely due to hybrid work arrangements. While there are only 8 hospitality buildings in the district, 6 of them have a recovery rate of more than 100%, indicating a strong return and increase in activity in hotels and related establishments.

        <h2>Cluster Analysis</h2>

        <p>
            Based on the recovery rate results, we conducted a clustering analysis to identify building typologies related to their recovery rates and other attributes such as building type (e.g. retail, office, etc.), building class (A, B, or C, which is a ranking of building quality, often reflective in rental rates) and usable space of the building (i.e. the total floor area to account for different building sizes). Specifically, we ran a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">k-means cluster analysis</a> on all office, retail, and mixed use office/retail buildings in the district. The categorical variables were converted to dummy variables (0 or 1) and the numeric variables on usable space and recovery rate were log scaled and normalized to a range from 0 to 1 prior to clustering. The number of clusters was based on analyzing the within-cluster sum of squares for different numbers of clusters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Based on our analysis, we find that there are 4 clusters, or types, of buildings.
            It is our hope that based on this typology, policy-makers and related stakeholders can see how different types of buildings are recovering more than others, and can design effective recovery strategies for downtownâ€™s diverse sub-areas, in Toronto.
